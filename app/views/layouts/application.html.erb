			    <h2>What is this all about?</h2>
				<p>Did you ever really want to lay some verbal smack down, but find yourself not having anything better to say than 'Your Mom' as a comeback?</p>
				<p>Well, I have no solution for that problem, but now you can Tweet your insult after the fact. You know, like a mature adult would do.</p>
				<p>Don't say it to their face! Say it to anyone who will listen (your followers) from a good safe distance.</p>

				<h2>Wow... really? That's all this site is good for?</h2>
				<p>In a nutshell. Yes.</p>
